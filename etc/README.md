Here you will find a couple of JSON files used for configuration of the API.

## config.json
Contains general configuration data.  This file is not currently used because the API code grabs all the configuration it needs from the regular Joomla configuration.php file.  It's here because one day it will be needed.

## services.json
Contains routes for services that are not provided by Joomla components.  Not currently used and contains dummy data.
